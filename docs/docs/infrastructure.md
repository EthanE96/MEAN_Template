# Infrastructure

## Sequential Documentation Plan

This section outlines the step-by-step plan to complete the infrastructure documentation for the MEAN Template project. Each step will be tackled in sequence, with updates and requests for user input or diagrams as needed.

### Step 1: Infrastructure Overview

- Gather a high-level description of the infrastructure.
- Identify and list key components (e.g., web app, API, database, storage, networking).
- **Action:** Request/upload a high-level architecture diagram (user to provide or update).

### Step 2: Environment Setup

- Document the setup for Development, Staging, and Production environments.
- Specify environment-specific resources and configurations.
- **Action:** List environment variables, secrets management, and provisioning steps.

### Step 3: Azure Resource Inventory

- List all Azure resources in the 'MEAN_Template' resource group (VMs, App Services, Cosmos DB, Storage, etc.).
- Note any shared resources in the 'management' group that are relevant.
- **Action:** User to provide a list of resources or run `az resource list -g MEAN_Template` and share output if possible.

### Step 4: Deployment Architecture

- Describe the CI/CD pipeline, deployment process, and rollback/recovery strategies.
- **Action:** Request/upload a CI/CD pipeline diagram if available.

### Step 5: Cloud and Hosting

- Detail the cloud provider(s), resource provisioning, and networking setup.
- **Action:** Use Azure resource inventory to fill in details.

### Step 6: Storage and Databases

- Document database instances, configuration, and file/object storage.
- **Action:** Use Azure resource inventory to fill in details.

### Step 7: Monitoring and Logging

- List monitoring tools, metrics, and log aggregation solutions.
- **Action:** Use Azure resource inventory and user input.

### Step 8: Security and Compliance

- Describe IAM, secrets management, and compliance considerations.
- **Action:** Use Azure resource inventory and user input.

### Step 9: Backup and Disaster Recovery

- Document backup strategies and disaster recovery plans.
- **Action:** Use Azure resource inventory and user input.

### Step 10: Cost Management

- Outline cost estimation, tracking, and optimization strategies.
- **Action:** Use Azure resource inventory and user input.
